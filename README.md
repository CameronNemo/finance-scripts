This repository houses a collection of scripts that answer questions like:

* How long will a nest egg last assuming constant expenses?
* Given a constant savings rate (inflation adjusted), how long will it take to reach a certain target amount?
* Based on past growth in account values, what is the expected future values of those accounts?
* During the purchase of a home, how much money is necessary up front to cover a down payment and closing costs?
* What is the typical volume of trades for a given stock, and how does that compare to historical volume?

This repository began as an attempt to get more familiar and comfortable with statistical software packages and visualization tools, such as R, tidyverse, ggplot, Python, pandas, and matplotlib.

Now, it carries useful tools to inform my financial decision making and planning.
